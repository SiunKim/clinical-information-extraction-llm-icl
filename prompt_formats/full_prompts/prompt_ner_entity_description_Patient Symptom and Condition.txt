Patient Symptom and Condition: Annotate current physical manifestations and conditions reported by the patient or observed during clinical examination. Extract the core symptom terms without general expressions or negations, focusing on clinically meaningful presentations.
Ex) "심한 두통이 있음" → "두통": Extracts core symptom without intensity qualifiers
Ex) "설사는 조금 있다" → "설사": Captures the primary symptom without auxiliary expressions
Ex) "facial edema, dyspnea" → "facial edema", "dyspnea": Identifies multiple distinct symptoms when separated by punctuation
Ex) Negation exclusion: "열감도 없다" → "열감": Extracts core symptom term without negation markers
*Note: Exclude clinically assessed diagnoses (e.g., "HTN", "gastric cancer"), which should be classified as Confirmed or Working Diagnosis entities.
