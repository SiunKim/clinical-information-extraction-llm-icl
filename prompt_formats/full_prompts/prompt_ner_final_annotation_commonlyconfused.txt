1. Confirmed Diagnosis vs. Working Diagnosis:
 - By default, classify established medical conditions as Confirmed Diagnosis unless explicitly marked with uncertainty
 - When a diagnosis contains both confirmed and uncertain components (e.g., "Pancreatic cancer, r/o SMA invasion"), split into separate entities: Known component as Confirmed Diagnosis ("Pancreatic cancer") + Uncertain component as Working Diagnosis ("SMA invasion")
*Key Note: Uncertainty indicators include not only explicit markers (r/o, R/O) but also phrases suggesting causation uncertainty (e.g., "due to", "caused by", "suspected", "에 의한 가능성 존재", "잘 감별되지 않는 상황")

2. Patient Symptom and Condition vs. Confirmed Diagnosis:
 - Classify as Patient Symptom:
  1) Current physical manifestations with clear anatomical references (e.g., "Lt shoulder mass")
  2) Temporary presentations without formal diagnostic terminology
  3) Direct patient complaints
 - Classify as Confirmed Diagnosis:
  1) Established medical terminology (e.g., "Lymphoid crisis", "functional neutropenia")
  2) Chronic or established conditions even when presenting acutely (e.g., "DVT", "obstructive jaundice")
  3) Formally recognized medical conditions with specific diagnostic terms
*Key Note: When in doubt, presence of formal medical terminology suggests Confirmed Diagnosis

3. Test Result vs. Patient Symptom and Condition/Confirmed Diagnosis:
 - Classify as Test Result: values directly associated with specific tests or objective measurements with clear test associations
 - Classify as Patient Symptom and Condition: subjective complaints and current physical states not tied to specific measurements 
 - Classify as Confirmed Diagnosis: relatively well-established medical conditions
*Key Note: Test Results should be paired with a specific Test and Measurement entity
